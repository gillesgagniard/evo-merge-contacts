How to install
--------------

The prerequisites are Evolution ebook development packages; on Ubuntu Natty, they are named evolution-dev and libebook1.2-dev.
You will also need SCons (also packaged in Ubuntu, package scons).

For a system wide installation :
$ scons prefix=/usr install

If no prefix is provided, it defaults to /usr/local.
